## Intake

Stichting Fly Aware offers an intake consult with Drs. John Midavaine (orthomolecular doctor) and Narda Veugelers (Raymedy therapist).  
An inventory of the problems will be made, possibilities for recovery discussed and a treatment plan made.   
This plan will be specifically designed for you. That’s why different ways of treatment will be used, ensuring your optimum support during this traject.
Together with you, John Midavaine will define the required course of action.
