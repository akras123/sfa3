Dr. Susan Michaelis is a former Australian flight instructor and airline pilot with over 5000 flying hours. These days she is an internationally recognised and leading advisor in aviation health and safety, and a Phd researcher in the field of contaminated cabin air and dangerous goods. Based in England, she has a Msc in Air Safety and is a qualified Accident Investigator.  
Last summer (2017), a study was published by the World Health Organisation about contaminated cabin air, in which she was one of the leading researchers.  
On the International Cabin Air Conference held in London on 19 and 20 September, she was one of the 36 international speakers.  
In 2010 a film was made by Fact Not Fiction Films of Capt. Tristan Loraine about the research on contaminated cabin air and the Aerotoxic Syndrome, on which she has worked for 13 years. This film is now made available for visitors of our website free of charge, and starts with a brief introduction by the producer.  
Many thanks to Tristan Loraine and Fact Not Fiction Films!
