### President

Drs. John Midavaine studied medicine. Being focussed on health improvement, he came in contact with patients with huge numbers of flying hours, who were looking for answers to treat their neurological health problems.

 John: “Besides my specialism in Sports Medicine, I have been engaged in Orthomolecular Medicine for a long time. In recent years I have frequently met people who fly frequently, either by profession or for business, often showing neurological problems. I’ve specialised in orthomolecular treatments in general, but in particular in top sport and aviation, which in a way is top sport as well.  I achieved good results there, amongst others for patients who fly frequently.
Nevertheless, I want to find out more about causes and results, which will eventually allow us to move our focus towards prevention. At the time, unfortunately there is still insuffcient knowledge about the neurological problems related to air travel."

“This is the reason why I joined Stichting Fly Aware. Our ultimate goal in future is to show up with more facts and evidence.”
